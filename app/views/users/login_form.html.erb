    <h3>A note about logging in</h3>

    <p>
      There is no password field. In fact, there is no indication whatsoever that you are who you say you are. 
      There's nothing special about users - username is just another piece of data that the user entered and we have to keep track of.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll learn more about security and authentication in the next couple weeks. 
      For now, don't worry about it beyond what you can see here.
